<h2>NAME</h2>
<p>
TazUSB - SliTaz LiveUSB utility
</p>

<h2>SYNTAX</h2>
<pre>
tazusb [command] [compression|device|file]
</pre>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>
	TazUSB is a utility designed for installing SliTaz to a USB drive. Unlike a 
	hard drive install, the filesystem is kept in a compressed "rootfs.gz" file. 
	The filesystem is loaded entirely into memory upon boot. This should
	increase responsiveness, protect the filesystem against accidental
	corruption and reduce read/writes to the USB drive. Once setup, this utility
	can also rewrite the root filesystem with any changes you have made since
	booting up, giving the effective benefits of a hard drive install.
</p>
<p>
	TazUSB supports FAT32/EXT3/EXT2 formatted drives using SYSLINUX and EXTLINUX 
	respectively. "/home" is mounted on boot using the UUID of your particular 
	flash drive. Unlike a device name, the UUID has the benefit of never
	changing from machine to machine.  
</p>

<h2>COMMANDS</h2>
<a name="usage"></a>
<h3>usage</h3>
<p>
	The command 'usage' will display a short summary of all available commands.
</p>
<pre>
 # tazusb usage
</pre>

<a name="writefs"></a>
<h3>writefs</h3>
<p>
	The command 'writefs' will take the current memory resident filesystem and 
	create a "rootfs.gz" file. If your flash drive is mounted as /home (as it 
	should be), the new filesystem will be copied to the drive for you,
	otherwise it is left on the root of the drive. Your previous filesystem
	will be renamed to "previous.gz" and can be accessed on bootup by typing
	"previous" at the "boot:" prompt. All previous filesystems are renamed to 
	rootfs.gz.unixtimestamp. These are not removed automatically, so you should 
	periodically delete these to keep disk usage down.
</p>
<p>
	Filesystem compression is supported in the form of lzma, gzip or none. 
	Using no compression is very quick (under 5 seconds) and useful if you are 
	experimenting with a lot of changes. By comparison, using lzma or gzip takes 
	a few minutes but will dramatically reduce file size. This is recommended
	when committing permanent changes to the filesystem.
</p>
<pre>
# tazusb writefs compression
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
# tazusb writefs lzma
</pre>

<a name="format"></a>
<h3>format</h3>
<p>
	The command 'format' is used for formatting a device for use as a LiveUSB 
	device. Currently, it supports formatting as EXT2, EXT3 and FAT32.
</p>
<pre>
# tazusb format /dev/name
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
# tazusb format /dev/sda1
</pre>

<a name="gen-liveusb"></a>
<h3>gen-liveusb</h3>
<p>
	"gen-liveusb" will install a fresh MBR, set your partition as bootable and 
	install syslinux/extlinux depending on the detected filesystem. It will then 
	copy the kernel and filesystem from the CDROM drive, and place this on the 
	target USB drive. This will leave you with a bootable USB copy of SliTaz. 
</p>
<pre>
# tazusb gen-liveusb /dev/name
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
# tazusb gen-liveusb /dev/sda1
</pre>

<a name="gen-swap"></a>
<h3>gen-swap</h3>
<p>
	The 'gen-swap' command re/creates a virtual swap file and places 
	it in the /home directory to be activated on each boot. This is useful
	for old systems with low memory.
</p>
<pre>
# tazusb gen-swap
</pre>

<a name="gen-iso2usb"></a>
<h3>gen-iso2usb</h3>
<p>
	This command performs the same task as gen-liveusb, only copying the Kernel
	and filesystem from a downloaded ISO image instead of the CDROM drive.
</p>
<pre>
# tazusb gen-iso2usb /path/to/iso
</pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>
# tazusb gen-iso2usb /home/tux/slitaz.iso
</pre>

<a name="clean"></a>
<h3>clean</h3>
<p>
	"clean" removes old rootfs.gz.unixtimestamp filesystems (see writefs)
	to keep disk usage down.
</p>
<pre>
# tazusb clean
</pre>
